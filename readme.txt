YOU MAY DELETE THIS FILE AND ANY OTHER FILE(S) BEFORE STARTING YOUR PROJECT

BlankSlate is the definitive WordPress boilerplate starter theme. We've carefully constructed the most clean and minimalist theme possible for designers and developers to use as a base to build websites for clients or to build completely custom themes from scratch. Clean, simple, unstyled, semi-minified, unformatted, and valid code, SEO-friendly, jQuery-enabled, no programmer comments, standardized and as white label as possible, and most importantly, the CSS is reset for cross-browser-compatability and no intrusive visual CSS styles have been added whatsoever. A perfect skeleton theme. For support and suggestions, go to: https://github.com/tidythemes/blankslate/issues. Thank you.

If you're creating your own theme or client project, open up all files and do a "Find and Replace All in All Files" on the word "blankslate" with your own slug and prefix.
